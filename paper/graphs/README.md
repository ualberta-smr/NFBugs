This file contains links to different types of graphs. We should discuss which work best, as well as improvements to be made.

The graphs here so far are:

        - 3D graphs 
              - stars vs watches vs forks: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/3/#plot  
        
        - bar charts
              - problem tag vs problem type: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/8/
              - stacked: problem type vs number tagged: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/13/
              - stacked: API related problems by star range and tag: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/21/
              - stacked: General practise problems by star range and tag: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/26/
        
        - scatter plots
              - API related problems by tag: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/18/#/
              - General practise problems by tag: https://plot.ly/~aradu12/23
        
        - violin plots
