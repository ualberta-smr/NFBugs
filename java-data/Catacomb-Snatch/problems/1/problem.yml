fix:
    description: made more class attributes private 
    commit message: >
            Refactor the Font class:
            - Put all member/class variables at the top
            - Add JavaDoc comments for every method
            - Change the visibility of all class/member variables to the strictest value possible
            - Introduce boolean isDrawableCharacter(char c) so Font.LETTERS doesn't have to be publicly exported, 
            and fix all other classes accordingly
