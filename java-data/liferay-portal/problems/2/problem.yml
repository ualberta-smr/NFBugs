fix:
    description: Removed reference to an object that was preventing memory release
    commit message: >
            LPS-64050 Don't keep the references to the bundles, we are creating a memory leak here, 
            since we are not releasing the bundle, every time we redeploy a bundle, we are keeping a reference 
            to the old one, preventing the classloader to be released

    method: 
        protected void setSingleDestinationMessageSenderFactory(SingleDestinationMessageSenderFactory singleDestinationMessageSenderFactory)
suggestion:
    avoid extraneous references to avoid memory leaks
