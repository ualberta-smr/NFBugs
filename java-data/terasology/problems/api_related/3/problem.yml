fix:
    tag: memory
    description: Programmers fixed a memory leak 
    commit message: >
        * Reset the visibility binding properly when the in game state is left.

        * This also fix an uncritical memory leak: The StateIngame reference could
          not be garbage collected properly before, because the HUDScreenLayer
          was referencing it implictly through the anonymous binding class.
