    description:  Made more specialized child classes from parent classes to improve performance
    commit message: >
            broke VertexEdgePipe and EdgeVertexPipe into mini-atomic pipes--OutEdgesPipe, 
            InVertexPipe, InEdgesPipe, BothVerticesPipe, etc. 600ms vs. 500ms runtime on a branching 3 depth traversal.

    method: 
        public class BothEdgesPipe extends AbstractEdgesPipe
        public class BothVerticesPipe extends AbstractPipe<Edge, Vertex>
        public class InEdgesPipe extends AbstractEdgesPipe
        public class InVertexPipe extends AbstractPipe<Edge, Vertex>
        public class OutEdgesPipe extends AbstractEdgesPipe
        public class OutVertexPipe extends AbstractPipe<Edge, Vertex>
suggestion:
    split larger classes into more efficient small ones
