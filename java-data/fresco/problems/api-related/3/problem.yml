            ImmutableMap and ImmutableList: initialize with known capacity
            Summary:
            The final capacity of these `HashMap` and `HashSet` is known at creation time. By providing the capacity parameter we avoid resizing them (and potentially save some memory).
            The default `HashMap#MINIMUM_CAPACITY = 4` and the `HashSet` is backed by a `HashMap`
