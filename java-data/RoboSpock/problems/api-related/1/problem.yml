    description: Initialized a ClassLoader once instead of multiple times to reduce perm space
    commit message: >
            Fix PermGen OOME
            *Why I did it?*
            When running multiple tests with RoboSpecification,
            perm size inreases drastically.
            
            *How I did it?*
            Large perm usage was due to creating separated classloader for every
            specification. Create RobolectricClassLoader as static field,
            initialize it only once reuse it among RoboSpecifications.
