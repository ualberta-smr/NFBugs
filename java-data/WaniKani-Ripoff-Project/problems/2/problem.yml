    commit message: >
            Fixed RAM usage
            Made some variables final/static for data encapsulation purposes. 
            Main fixed was changing the Kanji class to only generate it's stroke order image when the get method for the 
            stroke order image is called. This is due to storing the stroke order in the kanji objects as an attribute 
            caused the program to use 1.5GB of RAM

suggestion: 
    to improve security, use final classes and static/private class members
