fix:
    tag: memory
    description: reduce memory usage by only generating an object in a getter instead of stroing the attribute
    commit message: >
            Fixed RAM usage
            Made some variables final/static for data encapsulation purposes. 
            Main fixed was changing the Kanji class to only generate it's stroke order image when the get method for the 
            stroke order image is called. This is due to storing the stroke order in the kanji objects as an attribute 
            caused the program to use 1.5GB of RAM

    method: 
        public Image getStrokeOrderImage()
suggestion: 
    if storing an attribute takes up a lot of space, consider only returning it in a getter instead
