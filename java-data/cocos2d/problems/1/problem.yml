fix:
    description: Replacing enhanced for loops with regular ones improves performance because it saves memory space 
    commit message: >
            GC optimization for CCScheduler, now in tick() on idle allocating less memory. 
            For further optimization "for(Item item : collection){}" loops have to be eliminating 
            because they use internal iterators, and they allocate memory each iteration.

suggestion: 
    a for loop may be more efficient than a foreach loop
