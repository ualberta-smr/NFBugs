    description: Replacing StringBuffer with StringBuilder improves performance because it is not synced
    commit message: >
            Use StringBuilder in favor of StringBuffer
            This removes all instances of StringBuffer that are removeable.
            Uncontended synchronization in Java is pretty cheap, but it's unnecessary.

    method: 
        public String getMessage()
        public String nysiis(String str)
api: 
    java.lang.StringBuffer
api change:
    java.lang.StringBuffer -> java.lang.StringBuilder
rule:
    if syncying is not required, use a StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer to handle strings efficiently
