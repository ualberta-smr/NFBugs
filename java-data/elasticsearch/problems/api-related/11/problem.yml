fix:
    tag: memory, performance
    description: initialized ByteArrayOutputStream with capacity instead of default to save memory and avoid resizing
    commit message: >
            Search: Reduce memory usage during fetch source sub phase.
            If includes or excludes are set
            XContentFactory.xcontentBuilder() allocates a new
            BytesStreamOutput using the default page size which is 16kb.

            Can be optimized to use the length of the sourceRef because
            that is the maximum possible size that the streamOutput will
            use.

            This redcues the amount of memory allocated for a request
            that is fetching 200.000 small documents (~150 bytes each)
            by about 300 MB
