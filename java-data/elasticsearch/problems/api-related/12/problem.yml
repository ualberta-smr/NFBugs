    description: initialized ByteArrayOutputStream with custom capacity instead of default to save memory
    commit message: >
            [CACHE] Use a smaller expected size when serializing query results
            BytesStreamOutput allows to pass the expected size but by default uses
            BigArrays.PAGE_SIZE_IN_BYTES which is 16k. A common cached result ie.
            a date histogram with 3 buckets is ~100byte so 16k might be very wasteful
            since we don't shrink to the actual size once we are done serializing.
            By passing 512 as the expected size we will resize the byte array in the stream
            slowly until we hit the page size and don't waste too much memory for small query
            results.
