    description: hide user data when logging failed requests
    commit message: >
        Watcher: Hide credentials/secret data of integrations in toXContent (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4162)
        If a user specifies an 'Authorization' header in an HTTPRequest we,
        which might be needed instead of using HTTP Basic Auth due to using
        Bearer Authentication, then in case of an failure, the request gets
        logged including that Authorization header.
        In addition, each implementation of a sent message for jira/hipchat/slack filters
        out special fields when a HTTP request is written in case of a failed
        response in order to not leak secret data.
