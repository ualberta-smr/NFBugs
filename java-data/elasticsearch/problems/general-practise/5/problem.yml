    tag: memory
    description: prevent overuse of memory by setting an upper bound on processors
    commit message: >
        Limit the number created threads for machines with large number of cores
        For machines with lots of cores ie. >= 48 the number of threads
        created by default might cause unecessary memory pressure on the system
        and can even lead to OOM where the system is not able to create any
        native threads anymore. This commit limits the number of available
        CPUs on the system used for thread pool initialization to at most
        24 cores.
        Closes #3478

suggestion:
    limit number of created threads
