fix:
    description: Replacing enhanced for loops with regular ones improves performance. Also reduce memory space usage.
    commit message: >
            * Vastly improved memory overhead (32x32 chunks can now be displayed with a JVM heap size < 512 MB) whereas 16x16 where problematic with 1024 MB before(!) But make sure your computer/GPU can handle values > 16 chunks...
            * Removed foreach loops
            * The viewing distance in chunks can now be changed dynamically while running the game (set v_dist_z/v_dist_x)
            * The intensity of the fog now depends on the chosen viewing distance
            * Fixed small bugs
            * Invisible chunks are periodically removed from the normal updating queue
            * Added a pool for vectors
            * Some refactoring
