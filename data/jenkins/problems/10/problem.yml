fix:
    description: Programmers improved security by ensuring commands couldnâ€™t be guessed from their length.
    commit message: >
        I am quite sure I had a good reason for wanting the length of a masked portion of a command to be equal to the length of the thing that is masked... but for the life of me I cannot remember why.  Making all masks have fixed length to provide less information to password snoopers
