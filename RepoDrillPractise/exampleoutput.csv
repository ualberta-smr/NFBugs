f1ce2b139233da7e6932778944f376ef6e6e7743,"Wait robustness (#504)

Refactor port awaits for improved robustness:
* We now allow a list of multiple startup liveness check ports to be defined for a container. This helps, e.g. for the browser containers, and lets us wait for both Selenium and VNC ports to be listening. I think this will help eliminate random flapping tests in this area and should fix #466
* For exposed/bound ports, we now check that the port is accepting connections both (1) from within the container, and (2) from the testcontainers host. Previously, the internal check was done for Docker on Mac/Win and the external check for Linux. Now both are used for all environments, which simplifies the logic and gives a solid guarantee that the port truly is listening. (For reference, the internal check was done due to issues with the Docker networking stack opening a listening socket before the containerized service itself was listening).
* Also, we now have a WaitAllStrategy that lets more than one wait strategy be used. For browser containers, we now wait for (a) a log message, and (b) the listening ports to be available.
* Broken out some aspects of the wait strategies/port detection into separate classes and used this to help improve test coverage.
* Refactored/tidied some code in network link configuration that was redundant, using Docker API filters instead of streamed filtering of containers"

* Support multiple HTTP status codes for HttpWaitStrategy

In the context of elasticsearch test containers module, I'd like to
add an ElasticsearchWaitStrategy class which extends the HttpWaitStrategy
with some default settings so it will be even easier for a end user to
start an ElasticsearchTestContainer.

Anyway, in this context, I found helpful that the HttpWaitStrategy expects
more than on status code.

For example, you can imagine running elasticsearch in secure mode or
without any security. In which cases the elasticsearch service might answer 200 or 401.

status codes that have been provided with `forStatusCode()`.

the new one to make sure we test the new methods.

* Fix compile issue

* Support both Predicates and Status codes

Also use a Set instead of a List to avoid duplicates.

* Fix setter

* Revert unrelated change

* Fix error message (note that with predicates it might be incorrect though)
