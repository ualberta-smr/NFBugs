            NeedleTestCase: refactor driver setup to setUpClass
            This saves a considerable amount of time by not loading the driver
            for every test (50%+ of runtime with 7 tests with Firefox).

    method: 
        setUpClass(cls) in class NeedleTestCase(TestCase)
rule:
    avoid loading the driver for each instance
