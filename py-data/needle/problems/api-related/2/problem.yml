    commit message: >
           Refactored assertScreenshot into a context manager
           This allows tests to be written in this style:
                def test_about(self):
                  with self.compareScreenshot('body', 'about-us'):
                    self.driver.get('%s/about/' % BASE_URL)

            along with the traditional:

                def test_about(self):
                  self.driver.get('%s/about/' % BASE_URL)
                   self.assertScreenshot('body', 'about-us'):

            The difference is that the former case can be significantly more
            efficient when recording baseline screenshots as it doesn't require
            loading the page simply to declare that an existing baseline will
            not be overwritten

    method: 
        compareScreenshot(self, element_or_selector, filename, threshold=0.1) in class NeedleTestCase(TestCase)
api:
    needle.driver.NeedleWebDriver.assertScreenshot
api change: 
    needle.driver.NeedleWebDriver.assertScreenshot -> needle.driver.NeedleWebDriver.compareScreenshot
rule:
    avoid loading a page unnecessarily by using compareScreenshot instead of assertScreenshot
