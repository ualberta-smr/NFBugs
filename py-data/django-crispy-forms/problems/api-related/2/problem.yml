    description: Replacing class name checking with isinstance, because it can handle subclasses
    commit message: >
           Doing type checking with isinstance instead of class names
           `|css_class` will be kept for backwards compatibility, however is not a
           good practice to type check this way, as subclasses don't get recognized
           as these types, because they don't have `__name__` attribute set the same
           way as the parent class.
           Patch for issue #176

location:
    file: 
        crispy_forms/templatetags/crispy_forms_field.py
    method: 
        is_checkbox(field)
api:
    Object.__class__.__name__
api change: 
    Object.__class__.__name__.<equality operator> -> builtins.isinstance
rule:
    comparing classes with isinstance() is more reliable than using class names
