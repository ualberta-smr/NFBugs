            * WTForms-1.0.1 library added to codebase
            * input elements in templates replaced with wtforms elements
            * powerful jinja2 macro created and used for wftorm rendering
            * validation centralized in forms.py for better security
            * validation added to select elements (ie country dropdown)
            * forms automatically repopulated on errors
            * form errors look and act the same when javascript is on or off
