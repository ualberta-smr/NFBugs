            perf(Request): use try/catch instead of if..in for query string (#805)
            Use try-catch instead of if..in for query string. try-catch is cheaper and faster in Python, also more Pythonic FTW!
            Fixes #637
    commit: https://github.com/falconry/falcon/commit/27f4166
location:
    file: 
        falcon/request.py
    method: 
        __init__(self, env, options=None)
suggestion:
    if exceptions are expected to be rare, use try/except blocks instead of if/else
