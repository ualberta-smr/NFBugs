            perf(uri): Replace if...else with try...except in the decode function (#905)
            Most of the time the token will be found in the dict, so let's optimize
            for that and avoid an extra membership check (if token in _HEX_TO_BYTE).

location:
    file: 
        falcon/util/uri.py
    method: 
        decode(encoded_uri)
suggestion:
    if exceptions are expected to be rare, use try/except blocks instead of if/else
