        fix(Request): Improve access_route perf and error handling
        Tune performance of the Request.access_route property, while also
        making error handling more consistent, in the case that a header value
        is malformed. Also, add a test to ensure that wsgiref passes
        REMOTE_ADDR in the environment dict, as has been observed in production
        WSGI servers. This is necessary to ensure that Request.access_route's
        fallback to REMOTE_ADDR makes sense.

    builtins.str.split -> builtins.str.partition
rule:
    if only one separation is needed, partitioning a string is faster than using split
